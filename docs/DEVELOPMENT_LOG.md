# Development Log

**What this file is.** The living state of Inventory AI: what is being worked on now, what each
session actually finished and verified, what is blocked, and what should happen next. It is updated
at the end of every development session, newest entry first.

**What this file is not.** It is not the roadmap, the specification, or a release note.

| Question | Document |
| --- | --- |
| What is true today, what is half-done, what is next? | **this file** |
| What happened in a phase, with its measurements? | [`DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`](DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md) — append-only §27 records |
| Has this already been built, in one line? | [`PHASE_HISTORY.md`](PHASE_HISTORY.md) |
| What must the system do? | [`SYSTEM_SPECIFICATION.md`](SYSTEM_SPECIFICATION.md) |
| What are the architecture, security and phase rules? | [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) |

## How to maintain this log

1. **One entry per development session**, newest first. Same-day sessions may be merged if they
   share a plan; otherwise give each its own dated heading with a short purpose.
2. **"Completed" means executed and observed.** A file written, a commit made, a test written or a
   deploy triggered is not completion. State the command and the result, or leave the item under
   *In progress* / *Not completed*. A passing build is not a passing feature.
3. **Record what failed and why.** An abandoned approach that cost an hour is worth two lines; it
   is how the next session avoids repeating it.
4. **Never rewrite an old entry.** If a later session proves an earlier statement wrong, add a new
   entry that names the correction. The roadmap's append-only rule applies here too.
5. **Update *Current position* in the same edit** as the new entry. If it no longer matches the newest
   entry, the log is wrong at the top, which is where people read.
6. **Link evidence** to the roadmap record, test file, commit or evidence directory rather than
   pasting long output.
7. **No secrets, no credentials, no personal data.** Environment variable *names* only.

## Current position

**Updated:** 2026-11-01
**Goal:** finish and harden Inventory AI **V1** through production testing. No Play Store or App
Store release is being prepared.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Working now** | Nothing is in flight. The phone build, the two workflow fixes and the AI-41 verification are complete; what remains is cleanup and the follow-ups below |
| **Just verified** | `1.0.1` APK `64958ea2` installed over `1.0.0`; adjustment cancel/confirm, row-level transfer and the local-time answer all measured on the phone; PR #112 merged as `ad8426e` and serving in production |
| **Blocked** | Nothing this session. The next EAS build is subject to the monthly cap (one used today) |
| **Next after this** | Remove the temporary worktrees; investigate the stock-in deep link that ignored its `locationId`; check the single-location default on a one-location tenant |

### Open items carried forward

| Item | State | Why it is open |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Single-location default, on a real device | Jest only | The production test tenant has two locations; the behaviour is covered by `movement-workflow-guards` but has not been seen on hardware |
| Stock-in deep link with `locationId` | New finding, not fixed | Opening `/stock-in` from a row or a link showed "Choose a location…" even with `locationId` in the params; the transfer entry point did prefill its source. Recorded in the entry below |
| A transfer is two movements to the assistant | Known representation | The AI lists both ledger legs; Recent Activity renders one card. Decide whether the assistant should group legs in future |
| Two mobile Dependabot advisories (`zod`, `deepmerge`) | Deferred | No fix inside the consumer's declared range; do not force versions |
| OTA code signing | Blocked by EAS plan | Free plan only; a signed binary would reject unsigned publishes |
| Play release | Not started, deliberately | V1 testing first |
| L-17 password-reset action URL | Open, console-only | Cannot be set from code |
| iOS device acceptance | External verification required | No macOS on the development host |

### Resource budgets

Known limits, checked before spending one of them:

- **EAS Android builds** — free plan, monthly cap. The October quota was exhausted; the reset was
  used for **one** build on 2026-11-01 (`64958ea2`, versionCode 7), which carried AI-41 and the
  Sprint 1 mobile fixes together on purpose. Two earlier refused attempts still incremented
  `versionCode` (5 → 6, then 6 → 7) without producing an artifact. Do not retry a build while the
  quota message is present, and prefer an OTA when the change is JavaScript-only *and*
  `mobile/scripts/check-ota-publish.mjs` passes.
- **OTA updates** — free, but not unconditional. Runtime is `appVersion`; a native dependency or
  config that moved after the installed binary makes an OTA unsafe even when the change is JS-only.
  `check-ota-publish.mjs` is the gate; `--allow-native-change` is for a declared emergency only.
  On 2026-11-01 it correctly refused an OTA to the installed `1.0.0`, which is why a build was spent.
- **GitHub Actions** — free minutes. CI runs per pull request and on `main`. Batch small changes
  into one push rather than re-running the suite for each tweak.
- **Render** — one production service; every push to `main` redeploys. Verify the serving commit at
  `GET /api/health` (`commit` field) instead of assuming a deploy landed.
- **MongoDB Atlas** — the free tier has a storage and connection ceiling (measured at 512 MB,
  §27GE). Seeding and cleanup follow the phrase-gated commands in
  [`guides/9-seeding-development.md`](guides/9-seeding-development.md) and
  [`guides/10-seeding-production.md`](guides/10-seeding-production.md); never delete data to free
  space that a backup or an index change would explain.
- **Brevo** — used for verification codes, reset codes and invitations. Do not send test mail in
  bulk; a delivery failure is not a code regression until the provider log says so.

## 2026-11-01 — AI-41 local time and the Sprint 1 movement fixes, shipped and measured on the phone

### Planned

1. Ship the timezone-aware assistant to production (server change + a phone build that sends the
   device zone).
2. Ask "what moved today?" on the production app and compare the answer with the phone clock and
   the ledger.
3. Capture the same question on the old build first, so the fix has a measured contrast.
4. Build and install the same APK with the Sprint 1 movement changes, then verify the adjustment
   confirmation and the row-level transfer on the phone.
5. Record both increments and leave the repository, the log and the evidence in agreement.

### Completed and verified

| Item | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| AI-41 implemented: the client sends the phone's IANA zone; the server validates it, states the local date/time/offset in the prompt, and adds `localTime` to history and dashboard rows. Absent or unknown zone falls back to UTC, never a 400. | Commit `792f7d4`; `server/src/utils/timeZone.ts`; `server/test/AI41-local-time.test.mjs` |
| Merged to `main` and deployed. | PR #111 → `28840f9`; `GET /api/health` reported that commit, environment `production`, database connected |
| Local suite green after the deploy. | `TEST_MODE=1 node --test test/AI41-local-time.test.mjs` → **8/8 pass** (2 suites) |
| **Before** measurement on the installed `1.0.0`, phone in `Asia/Manila`, local clock 2026-11-01 07:29. | Answer: "15 movements recorded today (2026-10-31)", and a movement logged at 06:17 local was quoted as "2026-10-31 22:17" — the UTC instant, labelled "Local time". The defect reproduced end to end. |
| OTA ruled out honestly, not worked around. | `check-ota-publish.mjs` refused a publish to runtime `1.0.0` because native dependencies moved after the installed binary. The guard was correct, so the path became a new production-channel APK rather than `--allow-native-change`. |
| One APK carried both changes. | `production-apk` profile (temporary, not merged) on `deploy/ai-local-time`; mobile `tsc` clean; EAS build **`64958ea2`**, version/runtime `1.0.1`, versionCode 7, commit `452c329`. |
| Installed over `1.0.0` with data preserved. | `adb install -r` → **Success**; `versionName=1.0.1`, `versionCode=7`; the session, tenant and ledger survived, so no sign-in was needed. |
| Adjustment confirmation, cancelled first. | Confirmation named the product, `Main Warehouse`, `from 10 to 7 (-3)` and the reason. **CANCEL** left the form open, wrote **no** `ADJUSTMENT` row and left on-hand at 10. |
| Adjustment confirmation, then confirmed. | **ADJUST** → "Done. … 10 → 7"; exactly **one** `ADJUSTMENT` row (previous 10, new 7, reason `ZZ sprint1 adjust`); on-hand 7. |
| Transfer from the inventory row. | The row screen offered **Transfer to another location**; the form opened with product and source **Main Warehouse** prefilled, available 7. Moved 2 to **Shop Front** → "7 → 5", "0 → 2"; **two** ledger legs under one reference; inventory rows 5 and 2. |
| Recent Activity had no duplicates. | Three cards: transfer 08:47, adjustment 08:45 (−3), stock-in 08:42 (+10). The transfer renders **once** although the ledger has two legs. |
| **After** answer matched the phone clock. | "Four stock movements were recorded today (**2026-11-01**)", at `08:47`, `08:47`, `08:45`, `08:42` — the same instants as the Manila ledger (`00:42Z` → `08:42`). |
| Sprint 1 merged and deployed. | PR #112 (`5ac95e1`, merged **`ad8426e`**); CI green (server, mobile, secret and attribution guards); production `/api/health` moved to `ad8426e`, so the server-side reason gate is live. |
| Both increments recorded. | Roadmap §27HC and §27HD; `CLAUDE.md` index updated to 210 records; evidence in [`evidence/production-device-2026-11-01/`](evidence/production-device-2026-11-01/README.md). |
| Fresh local runs of the affected suites. | `phase04-inventory` **20/20**; mobile `movement-workflow-guards`, `inventory-submit-once`, `screen-focus-load` **16/16**; documentation guards **14/14**. |

### Not completed

| Item | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| Single-location default observed on a phone | The production test tenant has two locations; the behaviour is only covered by Jest |
| Server reason gate exercised with a raw production request | No production credential was used for a direct `POST`; the refusal is proven in the test database and the gate is deployed |
| A same-tenant before/after for the clock | The new APK restored a different stored session (`jaffy` / royal kludge) than the one used for the before reading (`jeffy` / inplay). The clock comparison is against the phone and the ledger, and stands; a same-tenant pair would be cleaner |

### Bugs and findings

- **The defect was bigger than a date.** The old answer rendered the UTC instant under the label
  "Local time", so a member could not tell it was eight hours off without checking the clock.
- **A refused EAS build is not free.** Two attempts incremented `versionCode` 5 → 6 → 7 before the
  quota check failed. The successful build therefore reports versionCode 7, not 6.
- **Installing over the app restored a different session than expected.** The phone was signed in as
  `jeffy inplay` before the install and `jaffy royal kludge` after it. Data and session survived, but
  the "after" half ran in a clean tenant with no movements that day; the test records were created
  there deliberately.
- **A stock-in deep link ignored its `locationId`.** `/stock-in?...&locationId=<Main>` opened with
  "Choose a location…", while the row-level transfer prefilled its source from the same params. Not
  fixed here; recorded as the first follow-up.
- **The assistant counts a transfer twice.** Its answer lists both ledger legs as separate
  movements; Recent Activity shows one card. Accurate to the ledger, but a member may read it as a
  duplicate. Candidate for a future prompt or tool-shape change.
- **The lock screen blocked adb.** The six-digit passcode cannot be supplied over adb; the run paused
  until the owner unlocked the phone. Plan for that in future device sessions.
- **`TZ=Asia/Manila` does not work in this Git Bash.** The host's `date` ignored it and printed UTC.
  Read the phone's own zone (`getprop persist.sys.timezone`) and clock instead.

### Blockers

- None for the work above. The next EAS build is bounded by the monthly quota; the OTA path remains
  gated by the native-runtime check.

### Next priority

1. Remove the temporary build worktrees and scratch scripts, keeping the evidence directory.
2. Reproduce and fix the stock-in deep link's ignored `locationId`; add a guard that a supplied
   location is shown, not silently dropped.
3. Verify the single-location default on a one-location tenant (device or a focused test).
4. Decide whether the assistant should group the two legs of one transfer before more members see
   the current wording.
5. Keep this log's *Current position* updated at the start and end of the next session.
